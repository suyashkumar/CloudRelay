# CloudRelay
A cloud-controlled physical relay with iOS, Apple Watch, and Web control applications based around the [Spark Photon](https://store.particle.io/?product=particle-photon) microcontroller. The applications can toggle the state of the physical relay from anywhere in the world (essentially turning on/off any device that can plug into the wall).
